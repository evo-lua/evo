## Features

Inspiration?

Evo.Lua merges the best of LuaJIT, the [Luvit]() ecosystem, Blizzard's [World of Warcraft Lua environment]() and custom additions to create a runtime environment that makes working with Lua as easy and convenient as working with JavaScript has become thanks to the [NodeJS]() project.

All credit and my personal thanks of the original works goes to the respective authors:

I understand myself as a mere curator of great ideas; creating a more readily usable take on Lua development wouldn't have been possible without all the great work done by others.

I love using Lua for things it was't really designed to do and if you do, too, then this project may be useful to you. It's not designed as a replacement for any of the above projects, but rather to make it easier for me to develop the kinds of applications I personally want to build.

* LuaJIT extensions and speed
